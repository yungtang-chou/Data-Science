    "# K-Nearest Neighbors from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pic/knn.jpg' width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN Stands for K-Nearest Neighbors. It's a **non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm** that makes predictions based on **feature similarity**: how close you are to your nearest neighbors. It assumes that **similar items will exist in close proximity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's mostly used as a **classifier**, where the class of the target variable is defined through **majority voting**. It can also be used as a **regressor**, where the value of the target variable is calculated through **averaging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will first implement KNN classifier and then entend that classifier to become KNN regressor. We will also load datasets provided in sklearn to compare the results with the standard sklearn model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## What is the main characteristic of KNN algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distances** between vectors are calculated to define what's so-called **nearest neighbors**. From these \"nearest negihbors\", we can derive classes (classification) or values (regression) for the unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Euclidean distance`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{\\sum \\limits_{i=i}^k (x_{i} - y_{i})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Manhattan distance`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\lvert\\sum \\limits_{i=i}^k (x_{i} - y_{i})^2\\rvert$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two distances above can both be discribed by a single **Minkowski** metric, and a parameter **p**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^k (\\lvert x_{i} - y_{i} \\rvert)^p)^{1/p} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When **p = 1**, the Minkowski metric is the same as the Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **p = 2**, the Minkowski metric is the same as the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sklearn, the default metric is minkowski and the p = 2. Thus, the default distance function for KNN classifier is Euclidean distance. If you want to change it to another type of distance functionm simply tune the value of p. For more information about the type of distance (the relationship of **metric** and **p**), please refer to the [sklearn's documentation about **DistanceMetric**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric.html#sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5,\n",
    "    p=2,\n",
    "    metric='minkowski')\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Uniform KNN vs. Weighted KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, KNN treats all the nearest neighbors equally. However, this can cause some problems. Consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pic/weighted.jpg' width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to **assign a color** to the undefined green datapoint, with **k = 3** the green circle will be assigned to the color **red**. With **k = 5**, the green circle will be assigned to the color **blue**. You might notice that the two red datapoints are much closer to the undefined green datapoint. Thus, intuitively this green datapoint should be assigned to be **red**. This is when the **weighted KNN** comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the distance between the undefined green datapoints and its five nearest neighbors are 0.1(red), 0.2(red), 0.5(blue), 1.0(blue), 1.2(blue). With Uniform KNN, these distances will not be considered and thus five datapoints will be treated the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the weights of the weighted KNN are obtained by taking the sum of inversion of distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the weighted distances to color blue will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\frac{1}{0.5} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1.2}) = 3.83 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted distances to color red will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\frac{1}{0.1} + \\frac{1}{0.2}) = 15 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, with the weighted KNN, the undefined green datapoint should be classified as the color **red**. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## How to decide the number of neighbors?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, besides the choice between uniform KNN and weighted KNN, we can see that the number of neighbors is the core deciding factor for the outcome. We should come up with some rule of thumbs when implementing this algorithm so that the results will not be affected by bias/variance due to sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has shown that **there is no optimal number of neighbors suits all kind of datasets**. When k is set to a small value, noise within the dataset will have a higher influence on the result; when k is set to a high value, it will be computationally expensive to compute the result and might be hard to interpret practically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **small number of neighbors** are more flexible fit, which will have **low bias but high variance**, and a **high number of neighbors** will ha ve a smoother decision boundary, which will cause a **lower variance but higher bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, you should choose an odd number to be the number of neighbors when the classes is even. Thus, you will not encounter the case when two classes are equally near to the undefined variable. \n",

When the number of datapoints increases to a very large number, this can be computationally expensive. Thus, in sklearn you can implement **KD Tree** and **Ball Tree** structure as an improvement for fast indexing.\n",
