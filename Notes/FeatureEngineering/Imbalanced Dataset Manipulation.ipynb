    "## Why is imbalance dataset a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced dataset is commonly seen in cases like fraud detection. Since the target variable is highly imbalanced, **we cannot use simple metrics like accuracy score to determine goodness of the classification model**. A cancer predictor that predicts everyone not getting a cancer is not likely to be a good one since only a few people in the entire world will get a cancer. You might probably get an accuracy score of 90% or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like fraud detection, most of the time there will only be 1% to 3% of fraud in the entire dataset. If you make a predictor that predict solely for \"**No Crime**\", you will get an accuracy score of 97%! That sounds wonderful, isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to deal with imbalanced data, then?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can deal with imbalanced data in to ways. First, we need **better metrics to evaluate the result rather than accuracy score**. Moreover, since the minority portion of the data is scarce, we may need to sample our data (to decrease the majority portion), or synthesize more data (to increase the minority portion), in order to let our model perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will implement some techniques come along with a pre-build package called **Imbalanced-Learn**. You can read the [documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/) for full code and explanation. I will also implement some visualization trick to visualize the entire process.\n",

One reason is that by fitting imbalanced data into machine learning models **the model might learn inappropriately**. In general, feeding imbalanced data to your classifier can make it **biased in favor of the majority class, simply because it did not have enough data to learn about the minority**.\n",

The under-sample method is to **sample 5,000 rows with the label $0$ from the 45,000 rows to make label $0$ and $1$ comparable**. The total number of rows in the dataset will therefore becomes 10,000. In this way, the machine learning model will not favor toward the majority label.\n",

    "While there is a basic oversampling technique that simpling duplicates the datapoints from the minority portion, here I don't plan to take a look at those since they are not the most effective ones that are used today. In fact, duplicating data does no good to your model as you can easily guess since you model cannot learn new things from your data. It's still the same old data.\n",

    "In this example, the 3 nearest example for the datapoint $x_i$ are included in the blue circle.\n",

    "3. **Choose one of these neighbors and place a synthetic point anywhere on the line joining the point under consideration and its chosen neighbor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nearest neighbors $x_{zi}$ will be selected and a new sample $x_{new}$ will be generated by the function below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{new} = x_{i} + \\lambda \\times (x_{zi} - x{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda$ is a random number generated within the range of 0 and 1 by the random seed. This interpolation will create a sample on the line between $x_{i}$ and $x_{zi}$ as highlighted in green in the image above.\n",
