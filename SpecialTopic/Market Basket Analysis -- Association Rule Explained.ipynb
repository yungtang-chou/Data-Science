    "In this era, it's hardly sufficient for a company to make profit only by selling one product at a time. You may have heard off the classic [Beer and Diapers](https://tdwi.org/articles/2016/11/15/beer-and-diapers-impossible-correlation.aspx) case, and this is how current companies can out-perform competitors, if they can know how customers behave while shopping. While it is entirely possible to come up with links by intuition, for example apples and oranges which are both fruits, some other relationships are hard to detect and can be exceptionally supprising, for example the Beer and Diapers example."

    "**`Market Basket Analysis`** is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. Say that a person who buy bread have 60% likelihood to also buy jam, but only a 20% likelihood to also purchase melons. In this case, you should try to juxtopose bread and jam, rather than bread and melons. For a company you should try to find associations between different items and products that can be sold together. This way you can generate higher \"marginal profits\" per order. "

    "\n",
    "Since there are infinite possibility in terms of this cardinality relationship, we use several metrics to help mesure the association. The three metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Support`**: the frequency of the combination of items bought. With this metrics, we can filter out items that are bought less frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Support = \\frac{freq(A,B)}{N}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$Confidence = \\frac{freq(A,B)}{freq(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally we will set the minimum **Support** and **Confidence** to detect valuable relationships (rules) instead of full but possibly trivial ones. From here there's a third metrics that can help.\n",

    "* **`Lift`**: measures the strength of any rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Lift = \\frac{Support(A,B)}{Support(A)  *  Support(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator implys the independent occurence probability of A and B. If the denominator $Supp(A) * Supp(B)$ is large, it means that the occurence of randomness is more rather than the occurrence due to associations. Therefore, we can utilize lift as the final judge the decide whether this rule is worth considering."

The key problem is that the mlxtend Apriori Algorithm requires a matrix having orders being rows and products being columns. For large dataset, this matrix cannot fit into 16GB RAM and thus cannot work on many computers. This is because this algorithm fails to optimize using the **Prune** technique and generate too many unused combinations. For detailed discussion, you can refer to [this github issue](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/644) for mlxtend apriori algorithm.\n",
