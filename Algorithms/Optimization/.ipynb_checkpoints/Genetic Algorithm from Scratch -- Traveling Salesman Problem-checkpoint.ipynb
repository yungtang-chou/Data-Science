Generally speaking, we can generate a population that contains some portion of the entire feasible solutions. If there is no better solution throughout the current population, Evolutionary Algorithms are able to crossover and mutate and generate new solutions that might be better than all in the current population.

    "In general, **evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms, belong to the non-deterministic class of algorithms. Therfore, there's `no guarantee of finding global maxima`**. However, it can find a good solution that is at least not too far away from the optimal. To look for the best result, you can concatenate your genetic algorithm with a local search algorithm to explore the neighborhood more. In more simple problems, deterministic algorithms are usually easier to implement and less resource intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other limitations of genetic algorithm is proposed below**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Sensitive to inital population`**: If the initail population is too constrained to certain portion in the entire feasible region, the genetic algorithm can also be trapped in local optimal. A wide diversity of feasible solutions is a wiser choice for the initial population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Stochastic`**: Usually evolutionary algorithms have a large stochastic component in the algorithm itself, i.e. initialization and mutation rate. Therefore, you need to find a statistical convergent solution with many more simulations. This should be taken into account if you only have limited amount of time, as the more generation in each algorithm (more time spent on one try), the better the output will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Black Art`**: Traditional machine learning methods provide a better way of explaining why the algorithm behaves this way, whereas the genetic algorithm is simply randomly guessing and exploring the solution space. Fine tuning all the parameters, such as like mutation rate, elitism size, and selection parameters, etc, is often just trial and error. Therefore, it is not advisable for problems that require analytical interpretations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Quality deteriorates as problem size grows`**: The larger the problem size, the larger the area to be searched by the algorithm. From the discussion above we can easily figure out that the larger the problem size, the harder the algorithm to search all the feasible spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Time for convergence`**: For a complex, computationally-intensive problem, it takes a decent amount of time to get a good solution from this algorithm. In practice, you often run the same algorithm plenty of time since it's not a deterministic approach.\n"
