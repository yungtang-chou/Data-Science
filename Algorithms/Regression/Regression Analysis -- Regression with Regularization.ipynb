    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning problem can be divided into two sub-categories -- **`Classification`** and **`Regression`** problem.\n",
    "* **`Classification`** refers to the task of assigning labels *`(yes/no, True/False, Ham/Spam)`* to data samples belonging to different classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can either be a two-class classification problem (mostly using **sigmoid function**) or a multi-class classifcation problem (mostly using **softmax function**). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Regression`**, on the other hand, refers to the task of predicting continuous values (scalar) by depicting the relationship between dependent variables and various independent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Linear Regression`, therefore, performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x) in a linear line. To find the line, **Ordinary Least Squared Method (OLS)** is widely used for regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For complex problems, **`multivariate regression / Polynomial regression / Regularization term`** is utilized to enhance performance while at the same time restraining loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is the most loved regression models of all, it is not the most robust and rigid, and may present multiple problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take a look about a **`simple linear regression model`** as well as the topic of **`regularization`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later notebook we will dive deeper into other forms of regression models.\n",

    "**`Variance`**, on the other hand, refers to how much a prediction could potentially vary if one of the variable changes. This metrics also depends on the number of samples. \n",

    "<img src=\"pic/bvex.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`low-bias, high-variance`** model often indicates overfitting, which means that the model learns too much from the training data that it even captures **noise** that is not part of the characteristic of the data, thus producing more errors when testing on the testing data. Error can even grow exponentially if the model overfits the training data too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`high-bias, low-variance`** model, on the other hand, exhibits underfitting, which means that the model doesn't learn much from the traninig data, thereby creating a \"way too simple\" model that can only capture few property of the dataset. \n",

    "Neither of those two above is ideal, and it's really important to strike a balance between bias and variance to find a good fit for the dataset.\n",

    "Fro the [Sklearn algorithm cheatsheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html), it is recommended to use **Lasso and ElasticNet** if only few features should be chosen given its nature of fast-shrinking to zero. If not, Ridge Regression is recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **if you have lots of variables and have no idea about respective importance, or suspect that not all of them are important**, **you should give Lasso and ElasticNet a first shot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sample size is huge, the cheatsheet recommends taking a look at the **Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor(SGDRegressor)**, which can also take in the idea of regularization via the parameter **`penalty`** and **`l1_ratio`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The examples above explains the obvious advantage of Lasso Regression, as it can easily generalize a model with numerous features to a model containing few important features. This feature selection function is beneficial when you have a very complex dataset that contains hundreds or even thousands of features. If you choose Ridge Regression Model, chances are you will receive thousands of coefficients close to zero, but non of them will be zero. Therefore, the Ridge Regression Model will have a relatively worse model interpretability compared to Lasso Regression.\n",
